# Work Day Scheduler

## Description  
This is my very first calendar application that you can access through any web browser. The application allows you to type in events for specific time blocks that will save to your local computer so that you can come back and update it at a later point. The application also dynamically updates the background color for each timeblock to show if you are in the past, present or future depending on the time. This project really helped me become more comfortable working with the dayjs function as well as jQuery, DOM manipulation, and local storage. I hope you enjoy using it!
